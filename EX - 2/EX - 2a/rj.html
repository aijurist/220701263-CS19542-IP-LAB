    <h1>Rajasthan</h1>
    <p>
        The western part of Rajasthan is relatively dry and infertile. Rajasthan is home to the Thar Desert, also known as the Great Indian Desert, and the Chambal River, which is solely responsible for the water supply in the region. Jaipur, Udaipur, Kota and Ajmer are known as the four smart cities in Rajasthan.
